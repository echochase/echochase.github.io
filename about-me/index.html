            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I'm pursuing a double degree in computer science and statistics at UNSW.
                I'm in my third year and I should graduate by May 2025!
            <br><br>
                My favourite COMP courses in uni so far are COMP6843 (WebSec)
                and COMP2041 (Software Construction); I highly recommend taking
                both as soon as you have the prerequisites. Cybersecurity might
                be an acquired taste, but 2041 is definitely for everyone.
            <br><br>
                After I graduate, I'd like to work as a security analyst
                (pen tester) or a full stack developer.

            <p class="big-text">
                These are some of my favourite people on the planet.
                Whenever life decides to take a breather, I drag them
                out to engage in the stupidest activities known to
                man.
            <br><br>
                Road trips are my favourite. But that takes ages to
                plan and execute! So I guess I settle for karaoke
                and getting dragged to pool.

            <h2>Pokémon Cards</h2>
            <p class="big-text">
                I was (am) unfortunately obsessed with collecting
                Pokémon cards. It's a good thing I got a bit lucky with
                my pulls - here's some of my nice cards!
            <br><br>
                I also like to make my own custom cards for my friends!
                I print out the card I want and stick it on top
                of a Pokémon card before laminating it. I've made
                a whole deck full and I'm not sure it's a flex to be so good at it...

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            <p class="big-text">
                Occasionally I like to mess around on the piano.
                I used to do grades when I was younger, but after
                getting my AMusA Diploma I was
                <b><i><u>exhausted</u></i></b>.
            <br><br>
                I had a phase where I watched a lot of TwoSet Violin,
                and my favourite composer is Bach. That being said,
                I absolutely sucked at music theory and barely managed to scrape a pass.
    
                Nowadays I just play songs I like for as long as I want.

            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work as a private tutor for HSC physics and maths.
                Those were my favourite subjects back in high school, so I'm really
                passionate about them. It's like being paid to yap for an hour or two.
            <br><br>
                I used to work for a tutoring company based in Burwood, where I tutored
                classes part-time and found my love for teaching. I also
                wrote an entire HSC physics textbook for them, complete with teacher's
                notes. I remember drawing up a makeshift legal agreement myself for
                the rights to the textbook, with the help of a law friend of mine. Even
                though I left when workload got heavy, I really enjoyed my time there.
                
                Nowadays I enjoy the freedom of working as a private tutor.
                But whether it's a public or private tutoring gig, all my students have
                done really well.
