            This section is dedicated to my personal project, Intrusion. I am developing this game
            as a web application with a few of my friends who are passionate about cybersecurity.
            <br><br>
            I originally made this game with physical cards, where I printed out all the graphics
            I needed, pasted them onto Pok√©mon cards (which I have so many of), and laminated them to
            keep them stuck together.
            <br><br>
            In this game, 3-4 security experts defend a vulnerable system against the efforts of one hacker.
            In the original version, one player had to act as the system (that the hacker is trying to breach).
            They are in charge of adjudicating the game, processing each card that the players send through,
            and announcing results at the end of every turn. The player acting as the system is essentially the
            judge; they're not on either side. The system's integrity is defined by the amount of
            <b>integrity points</b> that it has remaining; in a 5-player game, the system initially has <b>3</b>
            integrity points.
            <br><br>
            As a <b>Hacker</b>, you must infiltrate the system's defences and wreak havoc without exposing your
            identity. The Hacker wins if they are able to successfully lower the system's integrity points to
            zero through a series of attacks.
            <br><br>
            As a <b>Security Engineer</b>, you must work together to defend the company system against potential
            attacks, while performing your everyday tasks as an employee of QNova. QNova is a small company, so
            the security team has a lot of other roles too... 
            <br><br>
            The security engineers win if they uncover and arrest the hacker, or complete their combined task
            quota before the system's integrity points drop to zero.
