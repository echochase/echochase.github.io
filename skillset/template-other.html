            <h2>Effective Communication</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 22.5px;">
                When I took up physics tutoring at a small company, I had to communicate with a lot
                of different people; I was expected to keep my employers in the know, communicate
                to my fellow tutors before I substituted for their class, and to teach my students
                the knowledge they require for their HSC. This required effective communication
                skills which I quickly gained. I believe I can apply what I learned to my future
                workplace!
