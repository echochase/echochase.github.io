                Don't judge me, but I actually really like JavaScript (and TypeScript). My first
                exposure to JavaScript was in my Software Engineering Fundamentals course in my
                first year, where I collaborated with a team of 4 other developers to design a
                messaging app for a major project. I was also very fortunate to be assigned to
                a group of very strong programmers whom I learned a lot from, and we eventually
                completed the course with a High Distinction.
                <br><br>
                Since then, I've relied on my JS/TS knowledge a lot for both programming projects
                and hacking efforts; my web project, Machiavellian Pursuits, is written in TS for
                the backend. The create/join room logic, server logic and game logic is to be
                written solely in TS.
                <br><br>
                When I perform (ethical) hacking attempts, I often make use of HTML/JS
                vulnerabilities in websites, and I've become pretty good at JS-based attacks,
                like XSS and CSRF. But more on that in the Hacker section.
                <br><br>
                And while this is probably obvious, the webpage you're looking at right now has
                its fair share of JavaScript, but I'd be happy to talk more about my frontend JS
                (and relevant JS frameworks) experience in the HTML + CSS section.
