                I used Java extensively over the past few years, whether it was for my
                Uni work (COMP2511) or for my web project, Intrusion.
                <br><br>
                Java was the first object-oriented language I learned. After working on a series
                of large-scale projects, I have since mastered the language on the technical side
                as well as its associated practical skills, such as utilising UML diagrams and
                writing critical but concise JavaDoc.
                <br><br>
                My first real Java project was a satellite simulator, which allowed users to
                place different devices and satellites around Jupiter at different altitudes and
                orientations. The satellites facilitate the communication between the devices
                through file transfer; the system must compute whether or not a satellite is in
                range to oversee the file transfer in a given scenario, taking into account the
                orientation of Jupiter, the behaviour of the satellite and whether the satellite
                is in range long enough for file transfer to complete.
                <br><br>
                My personal project, Intrusion, is built completely in Java for its backend. Java's
                class inheritance makes it the ideal programming language to bring my designs into
                fruition; all interactions in the game stem from primitive classes such as Player,
                Deck and Card, which are implemented by more specific subclasses. This makes for a
                clean and easily-maintained codebase.
