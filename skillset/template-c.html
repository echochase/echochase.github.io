                This is where it all started for me. I first learned C in COMP1511 at UNSW, and it was
                my first ever programming language (that I've been properly introduced to). Since then
                I've never stopped coding in C all the way throughout my uni career.
                <br><br>
                One of my first personal projects was built in C - it was a very simple 'text editor'
                that could create, write or read a file. I built this during my first month into uni.
                <br><br>
                Since then, I took Data Structures and Algorithms where I wrote a search algorithm for a
                (made-up) flight database in C. I also used C extensively in my Operating Systems course,
                where I received a High Distinction; I coded some functionalities for the OS/161 Educational
                OS, including multi-threaded programming, deadlock handling, and file and memory management.
