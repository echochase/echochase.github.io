                Frontend engineering has a lot to do with HTML & CSS, which goes hand-in-hand
                with JavaScript (and frameworks). Through lots of practice, I've managed to grasp
                a solid understanding of the HTML and CSS, especially alongside JS.
                <br><br>
                I have extensive experience working with React and Angular from my part in developing
                my projects, Machiavellian Pursuits and Intrusion respectively. In both cases I had
                the opportunity to take my learning into my own hands and scour the web for the
                resources I needed to self-learn everything about what I needed to know. I was also
                fortunate enough to collaborate with very competent teammates who could guide me in
                my learning (shoutout to Henry especially for pointing me in the right direction).
                <br><br>
                This website, though, is written in pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. No frameworks. I might
                adapt it to one later, but it has really shown me how much frameworks like React
                makes my life easier.
