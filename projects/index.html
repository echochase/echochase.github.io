                    ICPC Connect is a team builder platform for the International Collegiate Programming Contest, 
                    a prestigious competitive programming competition for more than 50,000 university students around the world. 
                    Our clients are the ICPC executives for the South Pacific, including a UNSW Site Coordinator.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In developing this project, I worked in a team of 6 to create a service that connects students without teams,
                    reducing the workload for coaches who previously had to form teams manually. We also provided an interface
                    that makes it easy for coaches and site coordinators to view and manage all the registered teams.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As the Product Owner of this project, I was responsible for facilitating the effective communication between ICPC administrators
                    and my team, ensuring our product meets client needs and expectations. I organized stakeholder meetings at the start 
                    of each development sprint to receive client feedback and ensure alignment on priorities and requirements.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As one of two frontend developers, I designed the user interface using Figma, helping to optimise the user
                    experience and flow. We then faithfully implemented our frontend design using Typescript, React, Next.js
                    and Material UI.

                A web game about trickery and deception.
                <br><br>
                In Double Bluff, your goal is simple: be the last player standing. But the path to victory is anything but straightforward.
                <br><br>
                Up to six players enter a tense, strategic battle where each participant begins with 5 hitpoints and a handful of unpredictable options. Every turn, you'll declare three potential actions, but only two can be executed - and everyone makes their move simultaneously.
                <br><br>
                Standard actions include Attack, Defend, and Energy Shield, but each turn introduces a twist: a random power-up that might just change the tide. These range from straightforward heals to high-stakes gambits like Cruelty, which can instantly eliminate a target, or Prowess, which reflects enemy attacks right back at them.
                <br><br>
                Success in Double Bluff isn't just about raw power - it's about reading your opponents, masking your intentions, and making gutsy plays at just the right moment. Shield when you're expected to strike. Strike when they let their guard down. And above all - don't blink first.
                <br><br>
                Whether you're in it to deceive, survive, or dominate, Double Bluff delivers chaotic fun and intense mind games in every match.

                    Just a passion project I do on the side to practice my frontend and
                    UI/UX skills.
                    <br /><br />
                    My Mini Apps website features a suite of pocket-sized applications, including
                    tools, games, probability generators and more. The project is coded in ReactJS
                    and deployed using Vercel, with a lightweight backend for logging visitors.
                    <br /><br />
                    Alongside the applications found in the main page, my site offers a series of
                    achievements for visiting and playing around with the apps. I've also set up
                    JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) on my site to securely store user achievements without
                    needing to fear any client-side tampering.
                    <br /><br />
                    This project gave me a chance to combine my interests in frontend engineering
                    with my background in cyber security. It also had me playing around with cool
                    libraries to implement great features like speech-to-text.

                    This is a personal project I am currently working on with a
                    group of friends. Intrusion is a card game that models different cyber-attack
                    and defense scenarios on a vulnerable system. I created this game at
                    the end of last year, and its purpose is to introduce the public to
                    the world of cyber security, regardless of their background (or lack thereof)
                    in computer science.
                    <br><br>
                    We're developing this project with a slightly bigger team of 6
                    developers and 3 artists. We're using Java for the backend, and
                    React for the frontend. My friend Jerry and I are working on the
                    backend, and my friends Shaam, Sohum and Manav working on the
                    frontend. Finally, my friend James is doing the heavy lifting with
                    figuring out the server logic, i.e. how in the world we're going to
                    integrate Java Socketio into our codebase (seriously, the socketio
                    implementations need better documentation, and we don't want to use the
                    Java Socket Library unless we absolutely have to).
                    <br><br>
                    Right now we have about all of the backend game logic done, and
                    the frontend is making significant headway. The art is also halfway
                    done, since this project is thankfully less art-heavy than Machiavellian
                    Pursuits. We're thinking to deploy this project ASAP, though it depends
                    how busy everyone is once term starts. Either way, we already have a lot
                    to show for it!
