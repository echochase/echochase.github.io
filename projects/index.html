                    This is the personal project I am currently working on with a
                    group of friends. Intrusion is a card game that models different cyber-attack
                    and defense scenarios on a vulnerable system. I created this game at
                    the end of last year, and its purpose is to introduce the public to
                    the world of cyber security, regardless of their background (or lack thereof)
                    in computer science.
                    <br><br>
                    We're developing this project with a slightly bigger team of 6
                    developers and 3 artists. We're using Java for the backend, and
                    React for the frontend. My friend Jerry and I are working on the
                    backend, and my friends Shaam, Sohum and Manav working on the
                    frontend. Finally, my friend James is doing the heavy lifting with
                    figuring out the server logic, i.e. how in the world we're going to
                    integrate Java Socketio into our codebase (seriously, the socketio
                    implementations need better documentation, and we don't want to use the
                    Java Socket Library unless we absolutely have to).
                    <br><br>
                    Right now we have about all of the backend game logic done, and
                    the frontend is making significant headway. The art is also halfway
                    done, since this project is thankfully less art-heavy than Machiavellian
                    Pursuits. We're thinking to deploy this project ASAP, though it depends
                    how busy everyone is once term starts. Either way, we already have a lot
                    to show for it!

                    Just a passion project I do on the side.
                    <br><br>
                    Though still in progress, my proudest creation is
                    the Machiavellian Pursuits game, where players battle
                    for victory through manipulation and unstable alliances.
                    Having previously created the game myself, I first
                    printed this set of cards out to play with a group of
                    friends in person, but we quickly realized that it made
                    for an ambitious but fulfilling programming project. After
                    we clarified the rules and beta-tested the game, we took
                    to programming and decided on using ReactJS for the
                    frontend, and TypeScript for the backend.
                    <br><br>
                    We're a team of five friends, 3 of which (including myself) are
                    developers and 2 are artists.  This endeavour has taught me to think like a leader and project
                    manager as well as a developer; as the creator and being most
                    familiar with the details of the game, I am responsible for
                    directing the creative process as well as specifying the requirements
                    on the technical side. As of right now, the game is incomplete.
                    However, we have completed implementation of rooms (sessions) using
                    Socket.io, made significant headway on the graphics and backend, and have
                    finished documentation (including rules and gameplay guidelines) and plans
                    for user interface and game logic. When the game is finished, we will deploy
                    it publicly on a web server where it can be played and enjoyed from anywhere.
