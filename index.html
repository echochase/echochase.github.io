            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I'm pursuing a double degree in computer science and statistics at UNSW.
                I should graduate by May 2025!
            </p>
            <p>
                My favourite COMP courses in uni so far are COMP6843 (WebSec)
                and COMP2041 (Software Construction); I highly recommend taking
                both as soon as you have the prerequisites. Cybersecurity might
                be an acquired taste, but 2041 is definitely for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                After I graduate, I'd like to work as a security analyst
                (pen tester) or a full stack developer.

                These are some of my favourite people on the planet.
                Whenever life decides to take a breather, I drag them
                out to engage in the stupidest activities known to
                man.
            </p>
            <p>
                Road trips are my favourite. But that takes ages to
                plan and execute! So I guess I settle for karaoke
                and getting dragged to pool.

            <h2>Pokémon Cards</h2>
            <p>
                I was (am) unfortunately obsessed with collecting
                Pokémon cards. It's a good thing I got a bit lucky with
                my pulls - here's some of my nice cards!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like to make my own custom cards for my friends!
                I print out the card I want and stick it on top
                of a Pokémon card before laminating it. I've made
                a whole deck full and I'm not sure it's a flex to be so good at it...

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            <p>
                Occasionally I like to mess around on the piano.
                I used to do grades when I was younger, but after
                getting my AMusA Diploma I was
                <b><i><u>exhausted</u></i></b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a phase where I watched a lot of TwoSet Violin,
                and my favourite composer is Bach. That being said,
                I absolutely sucked at music theory and barely managed to scrape a pass.

            <p>
                Nowadays I just play songs I like for as long as I want.

                Though still in progress, my proudest creation is
                the Machiavellian Pursuits game, where players battle
                for victory through manipulation and unstable alliances.
                Having previously created the game myself, I first
                printed this set of cards out to play with a group of
                friends in person, but we quickly realized that it made
                for an ambitious but fulfilling programming project. After
                we clarified the rules and beta-tested the game, we took
                to programming and decided on using ReactJS for the
                frontend, and TypeScript for the backend.
            </p>
            <p class="black-font">
                We're a team of five friends, 3 of which (including myself) are
                developers and 2 are artists.  This endeavour has taught me to think like a leader and project
                manager as well as a developer; as the creator and being most
                familiar with the details of the game, I am responsible for
                directing the creative process as well as specifying the requirements
                on the technical side. As of right now, the game is incomplete.
                However, we have completed implementation of rooms (sessions) using
                Socket.io, made significant headway on the graphics and backend, and have
                finished documentation (including rules and gameplay guidelines) and plans
                for user interface and game logic. When the game is finished, we will deploy
                it publicly on a web server where it can be played and enjoyed from anywhere.

                This is the personal project I am currently working on with another
                group of friends. Intrusion is a card game that models different cyber-attack
                and defense scenarios on a vulnerable system. I created this game at
                the end of last year, and its purpose is to introduce the public to
                the world of cyber security, regardless of their background (or lack thereof)
                in computer science.
            </p>
            <p class="black-font">
                We're developing this project with a slightly bigger team of 6
                developers and 3 artists. We're using Java for the backend, and
                React for the frontend. My friend Jerry and I are working on the
                backend, and my friends Shaam, Sohum and Manav working on the
                frontend. Finally, my friend James is doing the heavy lifting with
                figuring out the server logic, i.e. how the %$&@ we're going to
                integrate Java Socketio into our codebase (seriously, the socketio
                implementations need better documentation, and we don't want to use the
                Java Socket Library unless we absolutely have to).
            </p>
            <p class="black-font">
                Right now we have about all of the backend game logic done, and
                the frontend is making significant headway. The art is also halfway
                done, since this project is thankfully less art-heavy than Machiavellian
                Pursuits. We're thinking to deploy this project ASAP, though it depends
                how busy everyone is once term starts. Either way, we already have a lot
                to show for it!
