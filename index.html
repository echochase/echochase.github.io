            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I'm pursuing a double degree in computer science and statistics at UNSW.
                I'm in my third year and I should graduate by May 2025!
            <br><br>
                My favourite COMP courses in uni so far are COMP6843 (WebSec)
                and COMP2041 (Software Construction); I highly recommend taking
                both as soon as you have the prerequisites. Cybersecurity might
                be an acquired taste, but 2041 is definitely for everyone.
            <br><br>
                After I graduate, I'd like to work as a security analyst
                (pen tester) or a full stack developer.

                These are some of my favourite people on the planet.
                Whenever life decides to take a breather, I drag them
                out to engage in the stupidest activities known to
                man.
            <br><br>
                Road trips are my favourite. But that takes ages to
                plan and execute! So I guess I settle for karaoke
                and getting dragged to pool.

                I was (am) unfortunately obsessed with collecting
                Pokémon cards. It's a good thing I got a bit lucky with
                my pulls - here's some of my nice cards!
            <br><br>
                I also like to make my own custom cards for my friends!
                I print out the card I want and stick it on top
                of a Pokémon card before laminating it. I've made
                a whole deck full and I'm not sure it's a flex to be so good at it...

                Occasionally I like to mess around on the piano.
                I used to do grades when I was younger, but after
                getting my AMusA Diploma I was
                <b><i><u>exhausted</u></i></b>.
            <br><br>
                I had a phase where I watched a lot of TwoSet Violin,
                and my favourite composer is Bach. That being said,
                I absolutely sucked at music theory and barely managed to scrape a pass.

                Nowadays I just play songs I like for as long as I want.

            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <p>
                I currently work as a private tutor for HSC physics and maths.
                Those were my favourite subjects back in high school, so I'm really
                passionate about them. It's like being paid to yap for an hour or two.
            <br><br>
                I used to work for a tutoring company based in Burwood, where I tutored
                classes part-time and found my love for teaching. I also
                wrote an entire HSC physics textbook for them, complete with teacher's
                notes. I remember drawing up a makeshift legal agreement myself for
                the rights to the textbook, with the help of a law friend of mine. Even
                though I left when workload got heavy, I really enjoyed my time there.
                
                Nowadays I enjoy the freedom of working as a private tutor.
                But whether it's a public or private tutoring gig, all my students have
                done really well.

                    This is the personal project I am currently working on with another
                    group of friends. Intrusion is a card game that models different cyber-attack
                    and defense scenarios on a vulnerable system. I created this game at
                    the end of last year, and its purpose is to introduce the public to
                    the world of cyber security, regardless of their background (or lack thereof)
                    in computer science.
                    <br><br>
                    We're developing this project with a slightly bigger team of 6
                    developers and 3 artists. We're using Java for the backend, and
                    React for the frontend. My friend Jerry and I are working on the
                    backend, and my friends Shaam, Sohum and Manav working on the
                    frontend. Finally, my friend James is doing the heavy lifting with
                    figuring out the server logic, i.e. how in the world we're going to
                    integrate Java Socketio into our codebase (seriously, the socketio
                    implementations need better documentation, and we don't want to use the
                    Java Socket Library unless we absolutely have to).
                    <br><br>
                    Right now we have about all of the backend game logic done, and
                    the frontend is making significant headway. The art is also halfway
                    done, since this project is thankfully less art-heavy than Machiavellian
                    Pursuits. We're thinking to deploy this project ASAP, though it depends
                    how busy everyone is once term starts. Either way, we already have a lot
                    to show for it!

                    Just a passion project I do on the side.
                    <br><br>
                    Though still in progress, my proudest creation is
                    the Machiavellian Pursuits game, where players battle
                    for victory through manipulation and unstable alliances.
                    Having previously created the game myself, I first
                    printed this set of cards out to play with a group of
                    friends in person, but we quickly realized that it made
                    for an ambitious but fulfilling programming project. After
                    we clarified the rules and beta-tested the game, we took
                    to programming and decided on using ReactJS for the
                    frontend, and TypeScript for the backend.
                    <br><br>
                    We're a team of five friends, 3 of which (including myself) are
                    developers and 2 are artists.  This endeavour has taught me to think like a leader and project
                    manager as well as a developer; as the creator and being most
                    familiar with the details of the game, I am responsible for
                    directing the creative process as well as specifying the requirements
                    on the technical side. As of right now, the game is incomplete.
                    However, we have completed implementation of rooms (sessions) using
                    Socket.io, made significant headway on the graphics and backend, and have
                    finished documentation (including rules and gameplay guidelines) and plans
                    for user interface and game logic. When the game is finished, we will deploy
                    it publicly on a web server where it can be played and enjoyed from anywhere.
