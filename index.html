            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I'm pursuing a double degree in computer science and statistics at UNSW.
                I should graduate by May 2025!
            </p>
            <p>
                My favourite COMP courses in uni so far are COMP6843 (WebSec)
                and COMP2041 (Software Construction); I highly recommend taking
                both as soon as you have the prerequisites. Cybersecurity might
                be an acquired taste, but 2041 is definitely for everyone.

            <h2>Friends</h2>
            <p>
                These are some of my favourite people on the planet.
                Whenever life decides to take a breather, I drag them
                out to engage in the stupidest activities known to
                man.
            </p>
            <p>
                Road trips are my favourite. But that takes ages to
                plan and execute! So I guess I settle for karaoke
                and getting dragged to pool.

            <h2>Pokémon Cards</h2>
            <p>
                I was (am) unfortunately obsessed with collecting
                Pokémon cards. It's a good thing I got a bit lucky with
                my pulls - here's some of my nice cards!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like to make my own custom cards for my friends!
                I print out the card I want and stick it on top
                of a Pokémon card before laminating it. I've racked up
                a whole deck full and I'm not sure it's a flex to be so good at it...

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            <p>
                Occasionally I like to mess around on the piano.
                I used to do grades when I was younger, but after
                getting my AMusA diploma I was
                <b><i><u>exhausted</u></i></b>.
                Nowadays I just play songs I like and for as long or
                short a time as I want.
