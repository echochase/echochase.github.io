        Machiavellian Pursuits

            This section is dedicated to my personal project, Machiavellian Pursuits. I am developing
            this game as a web application with some of my best friends, who are all talented designers
            and developers.
            <br><br>
            I originally made this game with physical cards, where I printed out all the graphics
            I needed, pasted them onto Pok√©mon cards (which I have so many of), and laminated them to
            keep them stuck together.
            <br><br>
            In this game, 4-7 players scavenge for resources and fight to complete goals in order to come out
            on top. Goals award a set number of points, ranged at 1-5 points, depending on their difficulty.
            The first person to reach 10 points wins the game.

            This game is designed to pit players against each other! Cooperations are often short lived as
            they are often followed by betrayal. In Machiavellian Pursuits, each player has exactly one
            chance to trade with another player during each turn. However, they must remain cautious as they
            may find themselves scammed after the trade! The It's A Scam action card allows the initiating
            player to take back the items they offered during the trade while keeping the victim's items.
            Fortunately, the game also offers the Binding Contract action card, whose presence during a
            trade forbids any Scam cards from being played afterward.
